Plumbing designs
===


It is difficult to know about a closed tank what it has inside. So, I'm numbering the plumbing design as the following. It is rather a memo to me than useful info.

Note that K-9, Fatboy-10, Stunt-11 etc are tank vessel designs. N°x is plumbing design and could be matched with any vessel design.

 - N°1 - plain stunt tank with straight feed pipe
 - N°2 - simple uniflow tank, feed exits on the spine halfway
 - N°3 - experimental tank with connections to a secondary tank. Similar to N°2 but on the bottom has 2 more connections. One full height one only to the bottom.
 - N°4 - experimental tank made of balsa, carbon tubes, and ciano inside. The cyano covering didn't work out.
 - N°5 - uniflow tank with a no-air brass filter ("syntherized") inside
 - N°6 - plain stunt tank but with a no-air brass filter inside
 - N°7 - uniflow tank with less internal tubing, for 3D printing. Feed and breath have small tubes inserted for fuel hose connection, and overflow tube is inserted from the bottom. 
 - N°8 - uniflow tank without any internal tubing, for 3D printing. Feed, breathe and overflow have small, printed nipples. Overflow is on top, but fuel level is clearly visible (PP polypropilene). Also thes have a small baffle volume, with an inclined baffle plate

Model identification
---

Then, each tank built has its model identification as:

    N°x{.y}-z
      |  |  |
      |  |  └- capacity of tank, in ccm
      |  └--- optional, number of baffle plates. Big tanks made of thin copper might have more than one baffle. Some tanks don't have baffle, then this number and dot are omitted
      └----- model number as per list above
