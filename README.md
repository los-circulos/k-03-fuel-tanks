# k-03 fuel tanks

Templates for copper sheet tanks and 3d printable plastic tank models

## copper sheet tanks

- SVG vector format plans for cutting sheets
- There are wooden templates to bend the sheets

Apart from the general SVG file, a separate cut files are included with each design, ready to be burn cut (one for ply, and another optimized for balsa 100mm wide boards).

### Material
3mm plywood or balsa.
- Plywood makes a nice template to precisely bend copper.
- Balsa would have to be glassed from the inside and used as the fuel tank itself (NOTE: it will have ~10% less capacity like this, the exact difference varies based on the chosen design.

### Designs
- K 9 - 30mm wide, narrow top angle "doghouse".
- fatboy 10 - 38mm wide, low profile tank
- stunt 11 - 26mm wide, slim but tall "basic" design

### Files provided
For each design (substitute k_9 with preferred design name):
- tank-k_9-45cc.svg - main file for a 45cc tank
- tank-k_9-45cc-cut.svg - cut file for plywood
- tank-k_9-45cc-cut-100.svg - cut file for balsa (100mm wide board)

## 3d printable models

- STF model files of various tank sizes
- legs with oval openings for adjustable height
- separate retainer design file

### Material
Currently I used polypropilene PP which resists most chemicals. For the retainers, I use PET.
- up to 125% overfill
- 0.16mm layer height, 0.4mm line width
- lower temperature for the top nipples (use postprocess script)

### Designs

- NO8 plumbing, direct tube nipple exits, no internal tubes
- fatboy low 6.5-30
- fatboy 8-41
- fatboy 8-66
- stunt 8-65
- stunt 10-100
